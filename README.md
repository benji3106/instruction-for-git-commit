Guide: how to make a good commit.

First of all, what is a commit?

A commit is a backup of a set of changes in a Git repository.
It records the state of the code at a given point in time, with a message describing what was changed and why.

Different message for a commit:

There is the feat: when we use this message it is for the 1st commit, whether it is a file or a folder, we must explain what we have done in a short and precise way.

There is the fix: we use this message when we make a modification, explaining where this modification takes place and what it brings, always in a short and precise manner.

There is also the docs: we use this message when we make a modification to documentation and only use it for documentation.

Here are the main messages to know. There are others, but these are the 3 messages to know and apply.
